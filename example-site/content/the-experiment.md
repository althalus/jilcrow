This project was founded on [Jilcrow](http://github.com/sjl/jilcrow) which in
turn was a fork of [Pilcrow](http://github.com/inky/pilcrow). The plan was to
combine a static blog engine with [Dropbox][] and s3 for magical updating without
needing to do anything more than just edit a file. So far, the plan is largely
unchanged, though it is a little on the rocks, since the dropbox feature I
need is only just released for applications still in development.

This page's existence, though, is to test posting an article in the future.
So although you see it here in my source, you shall never see it when you
build out the example project. At least, not unless you're using this 30 YEARS
after I wrote it.
