PILCROW
=======

A simple static site generator, tailored for my own needs.
(Work in progress.)

Requires Python 2.6, with the following modules:

    name        easy_install        url
    ----        ------------        ---
    dateutil    python-dateutil     http://labix.org/python-dateutil
    mako        Mako                http://www.makotemplates.org/
    markdown    Markdown            http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown
    yaml        PyYAML              http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML

At the moment there isn't any documentation, or even a list of features.
But you can get some idea of how it works by comparing the contents of
./example-site/ with the resulting site in ./example-site/deploy/,
which can be seen in action at: http://inky.github.com/pilcrow/
